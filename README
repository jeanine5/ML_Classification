This project was created under the guidance of the fauclty of the Vector Institute, as part of the Machine Learning course for Balck and Indigenous 
students!
The goal of this project was to use binary classification to predict if a customer of a telecommunications industry would churn (leave). This is my first 
time handling AI-geared code independently. Run this program in google colab (where it was made). It may take up to 6 minutes to complete running due tuning 
the hyperparameters, so I would suggest suggest running all the code before that specific part first (Google Colab allows you to run all code before a
sppecific chunk of code -- see Runtime).
